This was a bonus assignment for my Linear Algebra course @ Kennesaw State University during the Fall 2019 Semester. 

The goal of this assignment was to be able to enter a 3x4 augmented matrix and solve for all 3 variables (x, y, and z) by reducing the matric into RREF form using Gauss-Jordan Elimination method using any programming language of our choosing. 

I chose to use Java for this assignment.
